# Vanilla Web Dev Learning Projects

This repository contains small web projects (micro) I've made while learning vanilla JavaScript, they can be found under the "micro web projects" category on the landing page of the [deployed site](https://schak04.github.io/learning-vanilla-webdev-projects/).  
It also contains links to slightly bigger (mini) web projects, that have their own repositories, on the landing page of the deployed site.
